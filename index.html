        <h2>About Me</h2><br>
        <p class="aboutme">
                A recent graduate from Makers Academy, fully immersed in the world of technology and code.<br><br>
                
                Through Makers, I have had the opportunity to learn a number of languages, technologies <br>
                and frameworks working through a number of projects implementing various workflow processes. <br>
                I am continuing to grow and develop my knowledge through personal projects, study and meetups.<br>
                I am very creative and have a strong background in design where I developed an extensive knowledge <br>
                of Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign. <br>
                Having worked in the fitness industry for a number of years I enjoy keeping a good level of health, <br>
                which helps me to stay energetic and focused.<br><br><br><br>

                
                <span class="titleaboutme">Skills</span><br><br><br>

                Communication and Teamwork<br><br>

                Throughout my career, one of my most useful skills has been my ability to communicate with people. <br>
                I have an affable and empathetic nature, which has meant I have had great success in both client facing<br>
                and team based roles. I have developed and honed this skill in every role I have had from building business<br>
                as a recruiter and personal trainer, to running a team as a manager and most recently working in a successful <br>
                teams on projects at Makers Academy.<br><br>
                
                Creativity and Innovation<br><br>
                
                I am a creative person, which helps me to both understand and deal with clients and creative problem solving and<br>
                also thinking outside the box when solving logic problems. I have a strong history in design from my University <br>
                education and freelance graphic and fashion design work, in addition to this I started my own business in the fashion<br>
                industry (This project is on hiatus, while I begin my career in development - suspended not forgotten!).<br><br>
                
                Motivation/Attitude<br><br>

                My motivation and attitude in the workplace is one of the reasons I have always excelled. I maintain the belief that <br>
                positivity, communication and hard work are all imperative for a workplace to be at its most productive and enjoyable <br>
                for all involved. Because of this, in my two most recent places of work, I was fortunate enough to be promoted over more<br>
                experienced colleagues. At University I was voted in as Student President and put in charge of a team to be the voice of <br>
                the students, organise events and ensure a high level of student satisfaction.<br><br>
                
                Growth and ability to learn<br><br>

                I have always been and continue to be eager to keep growing and learning. I enjoy the challenge of constantly learning new <br>
                skills and developing my knowledge to further my career. Throughout my fitness career I completed a number of courses, some <br>
                of which were a year long, in order to better my craft. When I was focused on design I went on numerous life drawing, painting<br>
                and drawing courses and enrolled in internships to better understand the industry. Of course, most recently I have dedicated my<br>
                time to learning how to code at Makers, in my final two week project I managed to teach myself how to use a game engine and a new<br>
                language. I am looking to continue to learn and push myself both in the workplace and on personal projects.
